# ACGAN
ACGAN pytorch MNIST  modified from cgan 
This code was modified from a code on Github which is about CGAN. 
And this code is only a random demo, which still suffers from unstable loss. D's cls_loss isn't that robust. But G's generated imgs could match their labels well enough.
continuously updated  Hope for your sugggestion and guidance
