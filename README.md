# ACGAN
ACGAN pytorch MNIST  modified from cgan. 

This code was modified from a code on Github which is about CGAN.

This copy of code is more friendly than others to rookies in GANs and pytorch, with relatively simple networks and other settings and configurations.  
And this code is only a random demo, which still suffers from unstable loss. D's cls_loss isn't that robust. But G's generated imgs could match their labels well enough. 

Training D once while simultaneously train G twice in order to deal with mode collapse.  

This code will be updted continuously.  Hope for your sugggestion and guidance.
